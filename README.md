This project is created as part Coursera Data Scientist Specialization Capstone project. As part of this project, I have created a word predictor, that predicts the next word once the user enters a phrase.

The algorithm uses NLP to predict the next word using the previous two words by looking up in the corpus to find out the most frequently used phrases.

This app is designed to provide 3 unique words as predictions.
To use the app:
1. Click on the below link to open the application in a browser
2. Enter text in “Enter text” box and click on “Predict” button
3. 3 predicted words will appear on the right side under “Predicted words” along with cleansed word, response time and which N-gram was used for prediction.
